    Repeatedly remove edges from the graph to detect communities via the Girvan-Newman method.
    This modified version supports both directed and undirected graphs.

    The Girvanâ€“Newman algorithm detects communities by progressively removing edges from the
    original graph. The algorithm removes the "most valuable" edges first. After each removal,
    it measures the number of connected components in the graph.

    Args:
        G: NetworkX graph or directed graph (DiGraph)
        most_valuable_edge: Optional function that takes a graph as input and returns
            an edge to be removed. If not specified, edge betweenness centrality is used.

    Yields:
        tuple: A 2-tuple for each iteration:
            - First element is the set of communities (as frozensets of nodes)
            - Second element contains edges removed in this iteration

    Note:
        This is a modified version of the original NetworkX implementation with:
        1. Support for directed weighted graphs (converts to undirected internally for component analysis), as there are different weights for back and dorth routes
        2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm with the 'weight' edge attribute
        3. Returns information about removed edges for each iteration
